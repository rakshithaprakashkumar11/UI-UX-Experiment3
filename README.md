# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:

To identify and fix the biggest UX problems (heuristic violations) in Spotify by comparing it to Apple
Music, specifically focusing on how users find and save new music.

## Algorithm:

Select: Choose the 2-3 competing apps and the specific task (user flow) to analyze.
Define Rules: Use Nielsen's 10 Usability Rules (Heuristics) and a simple Severity Scale (0-3) to judge
problems.
Inspect (Target App): Go through the task on the main app (e.g., Spotify). Write down every rule
violation, its location, and its severity score.
Compare (Competitors): Repeat the inspection for the other apps (e.g., Apple Music) to find their
strengths and weaknesses.
Fix: Prioritize the highest-score problems in the main app, and design solutions based on the
successful methods used by the competitors.

## Inspection of Spotify (Target Application)

While analyzing Spotify, several heuristic violations were identified during the process of finding and saving new music.

One major issue observed is visual clutter on the home screen. The recommendation-heavy interface presents too many playlists, albums, and suggestions at once. This violates the heuristic of aesthetic and minimalist design and makes it difficult for users to quickly scan content. The severity of this issue is considered moderate.

Another issue occurs in the “Add to Playlist” flow. When a user taps on the three-dot menu, multiple options such as add to queue, like, download, and add to playlist are displayed. This creates cognitive overload and violates the heuristic of recognition rather than recall. Users must think more before taking action, making the experience less efficient. This issue also has a moderate severity.

## Comparison with Apple Music

Apple Music demonstrates better visibility of system status by providing clear confirmation messages when a song is added to the library. Its interface is cleaner and less cluttered, making it easier for users to discover new music. The minimalist layout helps users focus on content without overwhelming them.

However, Apple Music also has certain limitations. Navigation between sections can feel slower, and users often need to take more steps to explore new music. In addition, its recommendations are less personalized when compared to Spotify, which can reduce engagement for some users.

## Redesigned Interface

The redesigned interface focuses on improving the user experience for discovering and saving new music by addressing the heuristic violations identified earlier. The updated design simplifies content presentation, improves feedback, and enhances user control.
